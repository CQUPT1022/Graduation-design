> If you're new to AdSense, one of your first tasks is to connect your site to AdSense. This requires you to copy the code on your AdSense homepage and paste it into the HTML of your page, between the `<head>` and `</head>` tags.

Check [How to insert ad code in your WordPress site](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7527509).

Maintaining several plugins (often from different vendors) is not easy. And each plugin is slowing down the speed of your website.

**Speed Up Your WordPress: Replace them all with free Ad Inserter!**

**Quick Start**

To become familiar with the plugin check [Quick Start](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/quick-start) to display ads on your website.

To learn how to configure the most advanced WordPress AdSense plugin check documentation for [AdSense ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads): AdSense ad units, AdSense Auto ads, AdSense in-feed ads, AdSense in-article ads, AdSense AMP ads,...

Please note that code for AdSense ads may in some cases display blank ad blocks - no ads. This has nothing to do with the plugin. After AdSense code is inserted, Google needs some time (hours) to check pages before it starts to serve ads. Blank AdSense ad block means that AdSense code is inserted properly and AdSense code is running, only it doesn't display anything (yet). Typical reasons for blank AdSense ads are the following:

*   Your AdSense account is not fully approved yet
*   Your website or page was not approved for AdSense ads
*   Google has not checked and approved to serve ads to your website (yet)
*   Your AdSense account is banned
*   No ads available for your website
*   Wrong AdSense publisher ID or slot ID - check or regenerate ad code
*   Errors in ad code - check browser console for error messages

**Main AdSense Features**

To show AdSense ads you need to place code for AdSense ads on your website - you need WordPress AdSense plugin. Ad Inserter is a perfect tool to automatically insert code for AdSense ads on any page. AdSense integration and clearance options to make sure that your page will comply with the AdSense program policies, are just two advanced features that will help you to monetize your website with AdSense ads.

*AdSense dictionary*

Ad Inserter is also a powerful AdSense plugin. However, AdSense ads require some knowledge of ad terminology in order to use the right code for ads and to place them properly. This is a short list of commonly used terms:

*   Google AdSense: a program run by Google that allows publishers in the Google Network of content sites to serve automatic text ads, image ads, video ads or interactive media ads. Google AdSense provides the right ads for any audience: ads are reviewed to ensure they're high quality and relevant to your content or audience, even when viewed on smartphones and tablets. Block ads you don't like, customize where ads appear, and choose which types of ads fit your site best
*   AdSense text ads: ad with a title that's also a clickable link to a webpage, one or two lines of text, and a website address
*   AdSense display ads: graphical ads offered in several formats
*   AdSense video ads: one type of ads that can appear on AdSense sites - they can show on your pages if you have chosen to display image ads and are using supported ad size
*   AdSense richer text ads: a form of text ads supplemented with advertiser images that are displayed as "display-like" ads
*   AdSense ad unit: a set of Google ads displayed as a result of one piece of AdSense ad code - for AdSense publishers who want full control over the placement of their ads
*   AdSense ad code: a snippet of HTML that when placed on any page of an approved site shows Google AdSense ads in a specific ad layout and format
*   AdSense ad format: the way AdSense ads are shown to the users on your site - different ad formats can support different ad types, such as text ads, display ads, video ads
*   Responsive AdSense ads: ads will resize to fill available width
*   Fixed size AdSense ads: you define width and height of ads
*   AdSense In-feed ads: ads between similar-looking content blocks that repeat one after the other
*   AdSense In-article ads: ads that fit seamlessly in between the paragraphs of your pages
*   AdSense Auto ads: a code that you insert on every page once and it will automatically display AdSense ads **on positions chosen by the Auto ads code** - a fast and easy way for AdSense publishers to get up and running with ads
*   AdSense ads on AMP pages: AMP pages need different code for AdSense ads. Each Ad Inserter code block can be configured to insert different codes on AMP pages - you can use use built-in AdSense code generator to generate code for AMP AdSense ads
*   Blank AdSense ads: blank (empty) ad blocks when Google for some reason does not display ads
*   AdSense integration: connection between plugin and your AdSense account
*   AdSense Program policies: all publishers using AdSense ads are required to adhere to AdSense Program policies - if you fail to comply with these policies, Google reserves the right to disable ad serving to your site (you get blank AdSense ads) and/or disable your AdSense account at any time
*   Personalized AdSense ads: Google considers AdSense ads to be personalized when they are based on previously collected or historical data to determine or influence ad selection, including a user's previous search queries, activity, visits to sites or apps, demographic information, or location
*   Non-personalized AdSense ads: ads that are not based on a user's past behavior. Non-Personalized AdSense ads allow publishers to present EEA users with a choice between personalized ads and non-personalized ads, or to choose to serve only non-personalized ads to all users in the EEA. Non-Personalized AdSense ads only use contextual information, including coarse general (city-level) location.

**Insert Any Code Anywhere on the Page - Automate Insertion of Ads**

*   Automatic insertion of ads using standard (the_content, the_excerpt, loop_start, loop_end, the_post,...) or custom WP hooks
*   Server-side or client-side (javascript) insertion before, after or inside **any HTML element on page** (using CSS selectors #id, .class)
*   Manual insertion of ads with shortcodes
*   Insertion of ads with widgets or PHP function calls from child theme

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Settings for ads ... =

Check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/common-settings" target="_blank">common Ad Inserter settings</a>

= Does Ad Inserter insert any internal ads? =

No revenue sharing and no such thing as "internal ads" or "our ads" on your website. Period. What you configure is what will be inserted (+ some internal scripts for plugin features).
Ad Inserter is free, open source plugin and inserts only the code or ads you configure (blocks, Header, Footer). The code you see is the code that will be inserted. Please check page source code before you make any conclusion.
Of course, if you configure code block with some JavaScript ad code, then this code may insert some additional code or show ads. But please, don't blame the plugin for this.
You can also use Ad Inserter to insert code for AdSense Auto ads on each page (usually in the header). However, **the exact placement of ads will be done by the ad code, not Ad Inserter!**
[https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads)

The easiest way to check Ad Inserter blocks is to use **Label blocks** debugging function:
[https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging)

Please note that when you disable Ad Inserter you also disable insertion of all codes and blocks you have configured.
Therefore, if your issues go away when you disable the plugin THIS DOES NOT INDICATE any issue with the plugin! You need to try to [disable individual codes](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging#back-end) to see which one is causing trouble.

= I have installed code for AdSense ads and I see ads placed at random positions. =

You are probably using code for [AdSense Auto ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads).

AdSense Auto ads (known also as AdSense Page Level Ads) is a code that you insert on every page once and it will automatically display AdSense ads on positions chosen by the code.
AdSense Auto ads use Google's machine learning to pick the best placements on your pages to show ads. You only need to add one piece of code to all your pages, and let Google take care of the rest.

AdSense Auto ads may not be suitable for some WordPress themes or layouts. In such cases it is easier to place ads at wanted locations by using [normal AdSense code](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#ad-unit) and specifying exact locations where the code should be inserted.

= I have installed code for AdSense ads but the ad blocks are blank. =

Blank AdSense ad block means that the code is inserted properly only the ad code doesn't display ads. Typical reasons for this are the following:

*   After the ad code is inserted Google needs some time (hours) to check the pages before it starts to serve ads.
*   AdSense account is not fully approved yet - if your account is new you need to wait until Google checks ad codes on your website and and confirms your account. Usually this takes few days.
*   Your website or page is not approved yet - you need to wait until Google web crawlers check your pages.
*   Your website or page was not approved for AdSense ads
*   Your AdSense account is banned
*   No ads available for your website
*   Errors in ad code - check or regenerate ad code
*   You are using ad blocker

In such case you can try other ad networks for contextual ads. Check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/troubleshooting#ads-not-displayed">Ads Not Displayed</a> for more information.

= What is GDPR? =

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a regulation in European Union (EU) on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) that was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe. If you collect personal information from any EU citizen (within or outside the EU), you must first obtain explicit and unambiguous consent.

= GDPR compliance: What cookies does the plugin use =

Ad Inserter itself does not use cookies except for ad blocking detection when you use delayed action.

In this case 3 cookies may be used (to store pageviews and action settings): `aiADB`, `aiADB_PV` and `aiADB_PR`. However, no personal data is stored in the cookies.

Of course, the ads you may insert with the plugin may use own cookies - please check with ad networks for details.

= How to display a GDPR compliant cookie message? =

You can use any plugin for GDPR compliance / cookie consent. For example:

*   [Cookie Notice for GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/)
*   [Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/uk-cookie-consent/)
*   [GDPR Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/)

PLEASE NOTE: Installing GDPR plugin alone does not make your site GDPR compliant. Since ads you insert may use various cookies, you may need to make sure you have necessary configurations in place. Please check next question regarding showing ads based on visitor's consent.

= How to show ads based on visitor's consent? =

Ad Inserter supports inserting (showing) ads based on cookies or cookie values. You can define cookie conditions by black/whitelisting *Url parameters* (where also [cookies are checked](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/black-and-white-lists#cookies)).

PLEASE NOTE: If you are using caching (very likely) you also need to set **Dynamic blocks** to **Client-side insert** (tab &#9881; / tab General) in order to check cookies in visitor's browser and not when the page is generated.

For example, If you are using one of the following plugins for cookie consent you need to **whitelist the following cookie and value in Url parameter list**:

*   [GDPR Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/) - Whitelist `viewed_cookie_policy=yes`
*   [Cookie Notice for GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/) - Whitelist `cookie_notice_accepted=true`
*   [Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/uk-cookie-consent/) - Whitelist `catAccCookies=1`

= What is plugin usage tracking? =

When enabled, the information regarding WordPress environment and Ad Inserter usage will be collected and sent to plugin developers (once per month and on events like plugin activation/deactivation).

This is completely optional and can be disabled at any time. So if you have opted in (by clicking Allow when asked for permission) and now you would like to disable tracking, you should go to tab &#9881; / tab General, select **Disable** for Plugin usage tracking and save settings.

If this setting is not available then you have not selected any option yet - **tracking is disabled unless explicitly enabled** by clicking Allow when asked for permission (or when this setting is set to Enable).

What data is collected: Ad Inserter version, activation status, number of active blocks, date of installation, date of last saved settings, status of review notice and remote debugging, block class name, location, website url and name, WordPress version, language, text direction, charset, number of posts, active theme and version, list of installed plugins, PHP version, server name, IP address (used to determine country), site count for multisite installations, deactivation reasons and details (if provided).

Ad Inserter is only a plugin for WordPress content management software. It works together with WordPress, other installed plugins and selected theme.

This data provides information to make the plugin to be compatible with as many environments as possible, to test the plugin with commonly used plugins and themes, to understand why users deativate (and uninstall) the plugin and to get ideas to make improvements to the plugin.

If you are not happy to reveal this information and you have opted in, simply disable usage tracking as described above.

**Your decision will be respected.**


= I wish to show ads side by side but not in the same block. How do I do this? =

Configure block 1 and 2 with ads using:

*   Automatic Insertion: Disabled
*   Block Alignment and Style: No Wrapping
*   Enable shortcode: checked

Configure block 3 with

`[adinserter code="1" ignore="page-type"]
[adinserter code="2" ignore="page-type"]`

and use block 3 to insert ads.


= I use After Content insertion position but the ads are inserted after the stuff provided by other plugins. How can I insert ads directly after post content?

This happens because Ad Inserter processes posts last and therefore "sees" also content added by other plugins.

Try to set Ad Inserter plugin priority to 10 (early processing, Ad Inserter settings - tab &#9881; / tab General).


= How can I add some title or label (e.g. Advertisements) above AdSense ads? =

If this is a sidebar widget then you can simply name the widget.

For each code block you can also show a label above each ad. Default text (or HTML code) for ad labels can be set on the general plugin settings tab (tab &#9881; / tab General / **Ad label**.
To enable ad label above the ad go to code block for this ad, click on the Misc button and then on the Display tab check **Ad label**.

If you configured only text for ad label then the following code will be added above ad code: `<div class="code-block-label">AD_LABEL_TEXT</div>` (`code-block` is the block class name used, AD_LABEL_TEXT is the text for Ad Label).
You can then style the label using CSS for class `.code-block-label` (the best place for this code is Header section). If HTML code is configured for ad label then this code will be used (instead of the div code above).

In case you need a different label for some ad you can simply add label HTML code above the ad code. For example:

`<h3>Advertisements</h3>

AD_CODE`

Ad lables can be inserted only above ads (blocks) inserted by Ad Inserter - AdSense Auto ads are automatically inseted by AdSense Auto ads code.

= How can place ads below Read More tag? =

Configure ad block with the following options:

*   Automatic Insertion: After Paragraph
*   Paragraph Number: 1
*   Count only paragraphs that CONTAIN: `<span id="more-`

Check source code of your website for proper "read more" tag.


= How can I rotate between different alignments so I can test an ad aligned to the right against an ad aligned to the left? =

Set Block Alignment and Style to "No Wrapping" and create manual wrapping around both ads separated with [ADINSERTER ROTATE]:

`<div style="float: left; margin: 0 8px 8px 0;">
AD CODE LEFT
</div>

[ADINSERTER ROTATE]

<div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 8px 8px;">
AD CODE RIGHT
</div>`

Please note that responsive AdSense ads can not work with floating alignments (ad container width is not known) - either use AdSense code with fixed ad sizes or don't use floating alignment.
